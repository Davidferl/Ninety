This is the *mostly* unedited code that was produced during the competition

## Context 
We had 24h to create an app that followed the theme "_Social applications for a healthy population_".

We envisioned a social network that empowers people to achieve their objectives and develop healthy habits by being accountable to each other. In Ninety, our habit transformation app, you can join and create groups of people that want to achieves concrete objectives for a given activity. You decide what are your goals so they are personalized and achievable. Once you're in a group, you can log your activities that contribute to your goal. The app contains a general feed where you see other peoples logs in all your groups. Each group has also its own feed. You can comment and send encouragments to help the other members in your groups to achieve their goals by the end of the week. Finally, there is a profile page where you can update your profile.
